Project' Details
This project aims to design and develop a backend administrative portal for the Learner’s Academy using Java EE technologies. I developed it as a project of phase 2 for the Become a back-end expert course. The goal of this project is to apply servlet, jsp and JDBC concepts.
Product Backlog:
1.	Create database and tables.
2.	Connect the database to the project.
3.	Create Bean classes. Create Dao class, create Service controller  class
4.	Create a database utility class to retrieve data.
5.	Create login page.
6.	Create JSP files for all pages of the project.
7.	Create a servlet to get requests and send responses to the JSP files.
8.	Add cookies.
9.	Debug and Test the project.

• JSP: to handle the presentation view.
• SQL: to create and manage the database.
• JDBC: to make operations on the database for the project.

Core concepts used in the project.
• Object-Oriented: used to create and model objects for users and their credentials.
• Databases: used to store and retrieve data.
• Data Sources: used to define a set of properties required to identify and access the database.
• Collections: used some collections such arraylist to store collection of data.
• Exception Handling: used to catch problems that arises in the code especially in I/O blocks.
• Cookies: to store log-in data on the client browser.
